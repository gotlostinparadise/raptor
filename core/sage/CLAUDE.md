# SAGE persistent memory usage

Loaded on demand by RAPTOR's root `CLAUDE.md` when the `sage_inception`
MCP tool is present (i.e. when the user has run `libexec/raptor-sage-setup`).
If this file is loaded, SAGE is available — use it.

## Boot sequence

1. Call `sage_inception` to initialize persistent memory.
2. Call `sage_turn` every turn with the current topic + observation.
3. Call `sage_reflect` after significant tasks with dos and don'ts.

## Domains

- `raptor-findings-{repo_key}` — Vulnerability findings and analysis results (repo-scoped)
- `raptor-fuzzing` — Fuzzing strategies and crash outcomes
- `raptor-sca-{repo_key}` — SCA findings and verdicts (repo-scoped)
- `raptor-methodology` — Analysis methodology and expert reasoning
- `raptor-fp-{repo_key}` — Finding verdicts for cross-run FP suppression (repo-scoped)
- `raptor-rule-library` — Proven checker rules (engine + CWE keyed, cross-target, shared by `/agentic` and `/audit`)
- `raptor-exploit-cases` — **Experience layer:** oracle-proven solved vuln-instances distilled for cross-target reuse (global, not repo-scoped — the value is transfer to *similar* instances). Written only on a real `proof_kind`; recalled by problem-side signature. See `.claude/skills/exploit-cases/SKILL.md`.
- `raptor-concepts-{repo_key}` — Study/teach concept recall (repo-scoped)
- `raptor-audit-{repo_key}` — Audit hypothesis verdicts (repo-scoped)

## Domain rationale

- Use repo-scoped domains for target-specific outcomes that should not leak across projects.
- Keep `raptor-methodology` global because build/debug/analysis heuristics often generalise across repos and languages. Audit tool-confirmed observations go here for cross-target transfer.
- Store fuzzing strategy outcomes in `raptor-fuzzing` to preserve semantic recall across similar binaries.
- `raptor-rule-library` is global (not repo-scoped) because a proven checker rule should transfer to any target with the same CWE class.

## Mechanical hooks (core/sage/hooks.py)

Every SAGE hook makes a hard decision — skip, suppress, reorder, set a
flag. No prompt injection (recalled text dropped into an LLM prompt).

| Hook | What it does | Domain |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `recall_context_for_sca` / `store_sca_outcomes` | Short-circuit: skip LLM for confirmed-malicious packages | `raptor-sca-{key}` |
| `recall_context_for_fuzzing_strategy` / `store_fuzzing_strategy_outcome` | Mechanical AFL flag inference from prior strategy rows | `raptor-fuzzing` |
| `infer_afl_fuzz_flags_from_sage_recall_row` | Derive `-L 0`, `-D`, `-p explore` from recall content | (utility) |
| `recall_context_for_codeql_build` / `store_codeql_build_reliability` / `infer_codeql_build_from_sage_recall_row` | Recall prior CodeQL build outcomes; mechanically infer build command from successful priors | `raptor-methodology` |
| `recall_prior_finding_verdict` / `store_finding_verdict` | Cross-run FP suppression: skip LLM for findings with a prior false_positive/not_exploitable verdict and unchanged source | `raptor-fp-{key}` |
| `compute_finding_source_hash` | Hash source lines around a finding line for staleness detection | (utility) |
| `recall_proven_rules` / `store_proven_rule_metadata` | **Deprecated — no production callers.** Rule metadata is tracked by the disk `RuleLibrary` manifest. Kept for backward compat | `raptor-rule-library` |
| `parse_rule_metadata` / `should_replay_rule` | **Deprecated — no production callers.** Parse/gate utilities for proven rule recall rows | (utility) |
| `store_audit_hypothesis_verdict` / `recall_audit_hypothesis_verdict` | Store/recall per-function hypothesis verdicts with source hash. Only `clean`/`dormant` trigger skip on recall | `raptor-audit-{key}` |
| `store_audit_observation` / `recall_audit_observations` | Store tool-confirmed/refuted observations for cross-target transfer | `raptor-methodology` |
| `store_study_concepts` / `recall_concepts_for_study` | Cross-project concept skip: skip LLM when per-evidence hashes match current source | `raptor-concepts-{key}` |
| `store_teach_concepts` / `recall_concepts_for_teach` | Teach caching: store structured concepts from teach, recall for TEACH-0 skip gate | `raptor-concepts-{key}` |

## When to use

- **When scanning (SCA):** `recall_context_for_sca` fires pre-analysis; `store_sca_outcomes` fires post-analysis.
- **When fuzzing:** `recall_context_for_fuzzing_strategy` recalls prior strategies; `infer_afl_fuzz_flags_from_sage_recall_row` derives AFL flags mechanically.
- **When auditing:** hypothesis verdicts stored at commit time; tool-confirmed observations stored to methodology domain. Proven rules are tracked by the disk `RuleLibrary` manifest, not SAGE.
- **When studying/teaching:** concepts stored with per-evidence hashes; recalled and verified before LLM dispatch.
- **Before destructive actions:** call `sage_recall` with `raptor-methodology` for known pitfalls.

## Mechanical AFL priors (fuzzing)

When `raptor_fuzzing.py` recalls high-confidence strategy rows (>= 0.85),
`infer_afl_fuzz_flags_from_sage_recall_row` in `core/sage/hooks.py` may append
conservative `afl-fuzz` flags (`-L 0`, `-D`, `-p explore|exploit|fast`) before
the `--` separator. Set **`RAPTOR_SAGE_AFL_PRIOR=0`** to disable. CMPLOG and
other companion-binary modes are not inferred here — keep those explicit in
operator workflows.

## Graceful degradation

If a SAGE call errors mid-session (server restart, transient failure),
fall back silently and continue — SAGE is purely additive. Log the error
at debug level (matching `core/sage/hooks.py`'s existing pattern) rather
than surfacing it to the user. Never let a SAGE failure block RAPTOR work.
